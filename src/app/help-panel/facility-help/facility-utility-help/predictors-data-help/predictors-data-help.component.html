<p>Manage and track independent variables that affect <strong>{{ selectedFacility.name }}'s</strong> utility
    consumption. Independent variables (or predictors) are used with regression analysis to model and normalize utility
    usage between years. Common predictors for manufacturing include production, cooling degree days, and heating degree
    days.</p>

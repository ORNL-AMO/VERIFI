        Weather Data Used by VERIFI
    </h4>
    <p>
        This page provides a detailed look of the weather data available for use by VERIFI. The weather data is pulled
        from <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">The National Centers for Environmental
            Information</a>. The
        zip code you entered in the settings tab will be used to locate the closest weather stations with available
        data. If quality
        data is found VERIFI can autmatically calculate heating and cooling degree days. The calculated degree days can
        be
        used as predictor data for analysis.

<h5>Meter Grouping</h5>
<p>The utility meters can be grouped by utility type or user preference.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
    These groups represent your aggregated meter data for use in Visualization and Analysis. For reporting, they will be
    grouped by utility type and source (electricity, natural gas, etc.) or emissions scope.</p>
<hr>
<p>
    There are three types of groups: Energy, Water, and Other. The Energy group will contain all the energy meters
    (electricity, natural gas, etc.) and the Water group will contain all the water meters. The Other group can be used
    for all other meters including energy and water meters.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
    Clicking "<span class="fa fa-plus"></span> Add New Group" will allow you to create a new group. You can also edit
    existing groups by clicking the
    "<span class="fa fa-pencil"></span>" button or clicking the group name. This will allow you to change the group name and
    the meters selected to be a member of that group.
</p>
<hr>


<!-- <p>Meters can be put into groups by dragging the meter from one group to another or by clicking the &quot;<span class="fa fa-pencil"></span>&quot; for the
    meter. The &quot;<span class="fa fa-pencil"></span>&quot; can also move meters between utility types (Energy, Water) to Other or back (depending on the
    utility source of the meter). The "Ungrouped" group will disappear once you have assigned all the meters to a
    designated group.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
    The date range can be changed to adjust the data shown in the tables and graphs.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
    The tables show the calendarized meter groups.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
    The graph will show monthly cost and utility consumption. Either as bars or lines depending on what is selected.

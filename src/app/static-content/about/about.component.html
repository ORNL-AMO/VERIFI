                <h4>Verifi</h4>
                <p>The Department of Energy Advanced Manufacturing Office has tasked Oak Ridge National Laboratory to
                    develop a tool to track, visualize, analyze and even forecast facility utility data in industrial
                    settings. This tool will incorporate and expand on several existing DOE tools (EnPI, EnPI Lite,
                    Energy Footprint Tool, Plant Energy Profiler), most of which currently are excel-based or excel-add
                    ons. This project will integrate them into a common, open-source framework which is harmonized with
                    other DOE software tools – mainly the DOE’s MEASUR tool suite. </p>
                <h5>Intended Users</h5>
                <p>The tool is designed for industrial energy coordinators, plant managers, engineers, and personnel who
                    are interested in tracking, predicting, and preforming regression analysis on their energy use.</p>
                <h5>Data Storage</h5>
                <p>Application data is stored locally within the browser accessing the application and does not get sent
                    to nor stored on any DOE servers. It is encouraged for users to backup their data using the various
                    methods provided so that they have a copy of their data if browser storage is wiped.</p>
                <h5>Tracked Analytics</h5>
                <p>
                    Minimal analytics are tracked for where users are clicking and how often they are accessing the
                    application. This helps inform the development team of adoption of new features and drives
                    development
                    decisions. No personal user information is tracked and no user data regarding companies or
                    facilities is consumed by ORNL or its affiliates.
                </p>
                <h5>Open Source</h5>
                <p>
                    The application is being developed under an open source license. The code for the application can be
                    found on Github at <a href="https://github.com/ORNL-AMO/VERIFI"
                        target="_blank">https://github.com/ORNL-AMO/VERIFI</a>. Development progress and planning is
                    also done on Github, issues from the community are welcomed!
